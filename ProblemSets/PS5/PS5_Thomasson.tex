\section{PS5 - Non-API}

I am a huge NBA buff, so I brought in the daily-updated table of NBA Draft Lottery odds for teams currently out of the NBA Playoff picture. While it is not useful for my research, it is a guilty pleasure, as I can simply run the script on any given day going forward to download the most recent odds. I did not use any tutorial for this other than the Wikipedia example we worked through in class.

\section{PS5 - API}

This data will be more useful to Accounting research than the above section. The quantmod package in R allows me to bring in daily stock prices for any stock ticker I choose for the last 365 days. This can be especially useful if I am researching market reactions centered around an earnings announcement date.
