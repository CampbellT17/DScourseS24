\section{PS5 Questions}

I am not sure what it has to do with accounting research, but I love comparing historical NBA stats from past eras. So, Basketball Reference has a lot of data I like to look at when I get bored. That would be fun to look at. If not necessarily professionally productive...

As for questions raised in prior questions on PS5:

JSON:

mydf's object is "tbldf"     "tbl"        "data.frame"

mydf|date's object is "character"

Sparklyr:

df1's object is "tbldf"     "tbl"        "data.frame"

df's object is "tblspark" "tblsql"   "tbllazy"  "tbl" 

The columns are different in that df1's variable names are separated by a period if the variable has more than two words in its name, whereas df's variable names are separated by an underscore. I assume the difference is due to functionality/syntax in how sparklyr interacts with datasets.
